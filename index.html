    When I graduate High school I want to go to college in major in biology or Pre-Med. I want to go to Kennesaw Univeristy Or Georgia State Univerity.My dream is to help younger children be safe and have a healthy life. When I was younger I would hate to see young kids sick. That made me realize I can make a change.
